FAQ – Frequently Asked Questions

1. What is the UBI Protocol?

UBI Protocol is a revenue-sharing blockchain ecosystem where holders of the $UBI receive USDC distributions generated by multiple income-producing platforms.

2. How do $UBI holders earn USDC?

Each platform launched within the UBI ecosystem produces revenue. A portion of these revenues is accumulated and distributed directly to UBI holders, creating a recurring USDC income stream.

3. Why should I join the crowdfunding phase?

Crowdfunding participants receive access at the earliest—and most advantageous—allocation stage. Once the allocation closes or the price moves to the next tier, the cost of entering the ecosystem increases significantly.

4. When will the platforms launch?

Major UBI platforms such as the USDC Giveaway Platform, DeFi Layer, and Social App are scheduled for phased launches alongside or shortly after $UBI exchange listings, increasing demand and revenue potential for holders.

5. How will $UBI listings affect price and scarcity?

Listings typically increase visibility and demand. As new users enter the ecosystem, allocation becomes more competitive, and token scarcity may amplify price pressure—making early entry strategically valuable.
